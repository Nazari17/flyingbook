        <p>Hi. This eStore has been an idea of a colleague of mine. It should give me an insight of a real it-project from a to z. It was my first development project. I consider myself to be a Junior Developer. I am eager to become a Senior Software Engineer, one day. I am a python developer. Since this eStore is a training project, we do not really sell books here.

        My colleague not only had this idea but he conducted me throughout this project. He is a senior software engineer working as a freelancer.</p>
